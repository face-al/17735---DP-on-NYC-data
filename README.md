# Summary of the project
We used IBM's diffpriv library and applied it to 1000 samples of NYC taxi cab data. This project was for the purposes of Privacy Engineering in Spring 2023 taught by Dr. Hana Habib.

# How to run the code ?

There is no specific order to run the python scripts, but for regular linear regression run linear_regression.py. For applying the laplace or gaussain mechanism use the customized_linear_regression.py and change line 21 to laplace or guassian. For comparing results between different mechanisms run the compare_reuslt.py
